This PHP MVC framework is designed to provide a simple and easy to use structure for developing web applications. The framework follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application logic into three distinct components:

    Model: This component represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for retrieving and storing data from the database, as well as performing any necessary calculations or transformations on the data.

    View: This component represents the presentation layer of the application. It is responsible for displaying the data to the user and handling any user input.

    Controller: This component acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It is responsible for receiving user input, interacting with the Model to retrieve or update data, and then passing that data to the View for display.

To start building your web application using this framework, you will need to:

    Create a new project directory and initialize it as a new PHP project.

    Inside the project directory, create a new directory called "app" and within that, create the following directories:

    controllers
    models
    views

    Inside the "controllers" directory, create a new PHP file for each controller you wish to create. Each controller should extend the base controller class and define any necessary methods for handling user input and interacting with the Model.

    Inside the "models" directory, create a new PHP file for each model you wish to create. Each model should extend the base model class and define any necessary methods for interacting with the database and performing data calculations.

    Inside the "views" directory, create a new PHP file for each view you wish to create. Each view should define the HTML and PHP code necessary to display the data to the user.

    Create an "index.php" file in the root of your project directory. This file should include the necessary code to initialize the framework and route user requests to the appropriate controller.

    Create a .htaccess file in the root of your project directory. This file should contain the necessary code to redirect all requests to the index.php file.

    Create a config.php file in the root of your project directory. This file should contain the necessary code to connect to the database, and other configurations

Finally, test your application by running it on a web server and interacting with it through a web browser.
Note: This is a basic MVC structure and you can add more features and functionalities as per your requirement.
